# Project 3: Around The U.S.

This is the third project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the Figma design.

### Overview

* Images  
  
**Intro**
  
This project is to simulate a social media website, where users can share and like photos. The number of photos shown per row update as screen sizes change, going from a Desktop view down to a Mobile view.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Flat BEM file structure
- Animation and Hover Elements
- Grid display
- Media Queries

## Plan on improving the project

Currently the buttons do not change anything when they are clicked. I want to update them so the "like" button will change colors, and the "add" button will allow for additional pictures to be added.
There is no way to delete photos currently, which would be nice for users to be able to do.
Additionally, photos should be able to be rearranged. I would like to add that functionality without needing to delete and reupload images.
A possible update for users in the future would be to hide the "photo description" by clicking on the photo. Reclicking the photo could display the description again.
