# Project 3: Around The U.S.

This is the sixth project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML, CSS, and javascript, based on the Figma design.

### Overview

- Figma
- Images
- Javascript

**Intro**

This project is to simulate a social media website, where users can share and like photos. The number of photos shown per row update as screen sizes change, going from a Desktop view down to a Mobile view. The user has the ability to like cards, add additional cards to their profile, update their profile name and description, and delete cards. The forms for adding cards and editing the profile are now validated and will show error messages if the ueser enters incorrect information. The modals are also able to be closed when the Escape key is pressed, or when the user selects either the "X" button or clicks on the overlay.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Flat BEM file structure
- Animation and Hover Elements
- Grid display
- Media Queries

## Plan on improving the project

I would like to update the code so that it will save when the page is refreshed. Currently there is only one profile and no way to search other profiles. In the future, I would also like to implement an option for users to rearrange their cards easily, so they can showcase their photos in the order they wish.
