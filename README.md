# Project 3: Around The U.S.

This is the third project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the Figma design.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is to simulate a social media website, where users can share and like photos. The number of photos shown per row update as screen sizes change, going from a Desktop view down to a Mobile view. The user has the ability to like cards, add additional cards to their profile, update their profile name and description, and delete cards.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Flat BEM file structure
- Animation and Hover Elements
- Grid display
- Media Queries

## Plan on improving the project

I would like to update the code so that it will save when the page is refreshed. Currently there is only one profile and no way to search other profiles.
